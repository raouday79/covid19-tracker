My Covid19 Tracker is android application to fight COVID-19.

Due to increasing cases of COVID-19 in our country we wanted to help our society through our knowledge.
To tackle this situation we have developed a mobile application, details follow:
Application Title: My Covid19 Tracker
Platform: Android OS
The app is Design and Developed by: 
Student of Government College of Engineering, Nagpur
Zaveria Kulsoom and Uday Rao.

My Covid19 Tracker is a mobile application that runs on the Android OS of android version 6 and above.
My Covid19 Tracker focus on solving two major problems of coronavirus i.e Social Distancing and Contact Tracing.
Social Distancing:
My Covid19 Tracker helps in maintaining social distancing. People can share there locations while they are going outside.
They can easily see the crowds in their locality on the map. What's the crowds' status, at which shop people are less this can be visible on their mobile phones through our application. That will helps to plan their outdoor activity.

Contact Tracing:
Due to the large incubation period, COVID-19 is easily spreading. Hence we are targeting how to reduce this effect. We are using the contact tracing
through which a circle is drawn off the fixed radius(2 meters) around the person using their GPS co-ordinates which are updated at regular time intervals. The peoples coming close in contact with this circle are record.
Suppose if you are getting infected and your report is uploaded in the application, the application will notify all the peoples who were close in  contact with you from the past 10 days. Similarly, if someone uploads their report in the future, you will
also, get notified that you where in close contact with an infected person in the past.
Our application is design in such a way that it is not sharing any data between individuals.
My Covid19 tracker also gives live analysis about the coronavirus cases in India, health news and updated guidelines from the official authorities.
